# friendFinder
The goal was to create a Friend Finder app (essentially a dating app but for friends) using Node and Express servers. The user enters the page that leads to a survey. When the user submits the survey, they are matched with a "friend" that has the closest match to their personality.

## Built With
- Node.js
- body-parager NPM Package 
- express NPM Package 
- path NPM Package 
- Materlialize 
- HTML
- JavaScript

## Troubles
The /survey route does not work. Home page takes you to a dead page. My API friends route does not work. App doesn't open up in GitHUb or Heroku.
